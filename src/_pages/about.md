Hey there, folks! 👋 We're Mia Sinek and Trinity Takei, a dynamic duo crafting magic under the Valencia, Spain sun 🇪🇸. Swing by if you're in the neighborhood - we're always game for a cuppa ☕️ (our treat)!

Two decades of weaving others' dreams, we're finally spinning our own. Currently chilling on a sabbatical, brewing up some side projects (starting with: [rubymeets.com](https://rubymeets.com)), and conference-hopping (RailsConf, Rails SaaS Athens, Brighton Ruby, friendly.rb, Rails World - the shortlist). Look out for our brain spills on the blog!
