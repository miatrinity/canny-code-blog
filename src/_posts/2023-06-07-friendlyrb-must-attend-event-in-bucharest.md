## Hello, friendly.rb

Unless you've been chilling under a rock, you're probably in the know about [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world), the pièce de résistance of Rails in Europe, ran by [The Rails Foundation](https://rubyonrails.org/foundation).

However, there's a chance you haven't heard about this hidden gem in Bucharest: [friendly.rb](https://friendlyrb.com/). A double-day, single track Ruby conference.

Packed with camaraderie, a whirlwind of activities, and solid laughs with your circle of Ruby friends - and those about to join it.

It's an event you'd regret ghosting!

## Why Should This Be on My Radar?

For the love of DRY, I won't rehash the juicy details on the website - [take a peek for yourself](https://friendlyrb.com/).

But let me add my two cents - how this gem twinkled on *my* radar.

So [I hit up the Rails SaaS Conf in Athens](https://cannycode.io/rails-saas-conf-wrapup/), right?

I'd caught wind of friendly.rb before Rails SaaS, but told myself it was too outta reach, a mission from Valencia, all the money, yadda yadda.
Then two things happened.

1) The conference was a riot, and the folks I met? Top-notch.
2) Enter Adrian.

## When 'meh' turns into FOMO

Research and experience show that a CEO's vibe is the company's vibe. Consciously or not, the CEO is the genetic enginner of the company's DNA.

After two decades of clocking in at all sorts of companies, I cosign: gimme a snapshot of the CEO, I'll sketch you the company culture.

In the conference world, the CEO is the head honcho. Their vision, swagger, and modus operandi should clue you in on the conference vibe.

This heuristic has served me well, based on the conference cocktail I've sampled worldwide (a dozen or so and counting).

Take Rails SaaS - Andrew's dynamic charisma pulsated through the event, making it a no-fluff, high-octane rally that had everyone buzzing.

If my hunch holds up, Adrian, the main man of friendly.rb in Bucharest, should deliver a similar thrill.

And if my gut's right, I'd hate to be anywhere else when it goes down.

## Who is this dude, again?!

Who's Adrian? What's he about? Doesn't matter much here (but for the curious cats, he's the brain behind [Avo](https://avohq.io/) - give it a whirl, it's all kinds of avosome (pardon fo the horrible pun ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)).

The crux here is: _how_ Adrian plays his game.

Sure, we only hung out for a few hours (and a couple rounds of retzina), but this guy oozes MINASWAN. Friendly.rb's name is a direct reflection of Adrian - he's a one-man welcoming committee. Around him, it's tough to keep a straight face - I was grinning like the Cheshire cat on party drugs.

And let's not forget he's the go-to for all your pre-, post-, and mid-conference fun.

I'd bet my last penny there won't be any shortage of that in Bucharest.

## Just Buy those Tickets Already!

To cut to the chase: if a few days of top-notch Ruby talks, good vibes, and quality time with a friendly crew sound like your jam, friendly.rb's the place to be.

I've just locked down my tickets and snagged a sick-looking Airbnb for a steal!

Can't wait for the adventure.

See you in the mix?
